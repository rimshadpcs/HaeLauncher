1. The app has been developed as per the instructions
2. The API endpoints are appended in a single card view, and will be cycled through every 3.5 seconds
3. An onclick listener has also appended to the cardview, other than 3.5 seconds delay, the click can also switch the API and data in it.
4. The Nottingham API is not working, nevertheless I have included this in the Project.
5. I used a digital clock instead of an analog clock.
